You can call me Sameer/Sam(he/his).

I am a Software Developer by profession. You can ask me questions about Haskell and TS.
I believe that being able to learn and adapt to different situations are my biggest strengths.
By far, my biggest weakness is my self-esteem, but yes, I'm working on it! ðŸ’ª

As a programmer/developer I spend time building web-apps and/or fiddling with parsers and compilers!

I am an _opinionated_ developer with a sharp dedication towards writing clean and expressive code.
At this point in my life I feel they work in most cases and are _good starting points_ to help me become better.
Of course, they are no guarantee for success, but I feel they lead me to writing code <u>that is easy to
tear down or build on top of</u>.

Clojure, TypeScript, Haskell(Æ›) and Rust ðŸ¦€ are my favorite languages to use.

Emacs and VS Code(at times) are my weapon(s) of choice.

Iosevka, MonoLisa and JetBrains Mono are my go-to typefaces.

I also watch &amp; play a lot of sports. In my previous life, I was a sportsman. Roller Skating! ðŸ›¼
I have represented my [school](http://cbse-mls.kumarans.org/) and my state in many competitions and have been won many bronze and silver medals. ðŸ¥‰ðŸ¥ˆ

Fan of Arsenal, Golden State Warriors and the Scuderia Ferrari F1 team.

I cite Kobe Bryant, Richard Feynman and Marshall Mathers as my inspirations.
