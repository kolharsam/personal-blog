At this year's Hasura Con, I was given a chance to speak about the `useReducer` React hook. This was my very first speaking engagement as an engineer. I was thoroughly surprised that my proposal was chosen. Public speaking wasn't always my forte. This was indeed an excellent way to get out of my comfort zone. I was talking about something that I was passionate about as well. The very comprehensive `useReducer` hook. I don't seem to know why but I always love talking about the `reduce` method or something related. Functional programming, in general, is something I always like to discuss and learn about. 

Hasura Con 2021 had many other great talks and events. Please consider showing them all your love here: https://hasura.io/events/hasura-con-2021/. My absolute favourite session was the `SQLite: Implement a new backend`. Simply because I got to learn about what our `@data-sources-team` gets to work with every day, and it was just an excuse to exercise my curiosity throughout the workshop. Closely following that was the `How we build Hasura Cloud using Hasura`, given by my dear friend [Shraddha Agrawal](https://shraddhaag.dev/). In addition to these, there were other exciting conversations, ensuring that there was something for everyone! I learnt that the [graphql-engine](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine) would be partly responsible for the live stats on the NY Times. I mean, BLOODY HELL!

I have linked the slides and the recording of my talk here.

Once again, a massive thank you to everyone at Hasura for the opportunity. I hope that I did a decent enough job with it folks. My participation in this event reminds me of a certain line by a certain William Shakesphere from his play _As You Like It_.

> All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts, his acts being seven ages.

Onwards and upwards! ðŸ™Œ
